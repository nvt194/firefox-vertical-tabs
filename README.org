My copy of @ranmaru22 's Firefox Vertical Tabs, with few tweaks for my liking.

Vertical tabs for Firefox, inspired by Edge.
Works with Light theme, Dark theme, and System theme (auto dark mode).
It also plays nice with Container Tabs.

** Compatibility
Compatible with Firefox 90.Tested for Macos and Windows.

** How to install
- Go to ~about:config~ in your URL bar, search for
  ~toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets~ and set it to ~true~.
- Go to ~about:profiles~ in your URL bar, click /"Open Directory"/ next to your Root
  Directory under your default profile.
- If there is no ~chrome~ folder, create it.
- Create a file called ~userChrome.css~ inside the ~chrome~ folder.
- Copy and paste the contents of ~userChrome.css~ into your file (or symlink it).
- OPTIONAL: Adjust ~--delay~ setting in the ~userChrome.css~ file.
- Install the [[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tabcenter-reborn/][Tab Center Reborn]] extension.
- Make sure to enable /"Allow this extension to run in Private windows"/ so you're
  not left stranded while browsing.
- Go to ~about:addons~ in your URL bar, select *Tab Center Reborn*, go to
  *Preferences* and set:
  - *Animations*: on.
  - *Use current browser theme*: on, if you want to use dark mode.
  - *Compact Mode*: either /"Dynamic"/ or /"Enabled"/. It works with /"Disabled"/ too
    but looks nicer with only favicons.
  - *Favicon-only pinned tabs*: off.
  - Activate *Custom Stylesheet* and paste the contents of ~tabCenterReborn.css~
    into the text area below, and click /"Save CSS"/ under the text box.
- Restart Firefox.
