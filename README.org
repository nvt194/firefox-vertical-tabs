My copy of @ranmaru22 's Firefox Vertical Tabs, with few tweaks for my liking.

Vertical tabs for Firefox, inspired by Edge.
Works with Light theme, Dark theme, and System theme (auto dark mode).
It also plays nice with Container Tabs.

** Compatibility
Compatible with Firefox 90.Tested for Linux and Windows with titlebar on the right.

** How to install
- Go to =about:config= in your URL bar, search for ~toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets~ and set it to ~true~.
- Go to =about:profiles= in your URL bar, click "Open Directory" next to your Root Directory under your default profile
  + If there is no =chrome= folder, create it.
  + Create a file called =userChrome.css= inside the =chrome= folder.
  + Copy & Paste the contents of [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ranmaru22/firefox-vertical-tabs/main/userChrome.css][userChrome.css]] into your =userChrome.css= file.

- Install the [[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tabcenter-reborn/][Tab Center Reborn]] extension.
- Go to =about:addons= in your URL bar, select /Tab Center Reborn/, go to /Preferences/ and set:
  + /Animations/: on.
  + /Use current browser theme/: on, if you want to use dark mode.
  + /Compact Mode/: either "Dynamic" or "Enabled". It works with "Disabled" too but looks nicer with only favicons.
  + /Favicon-only pinned tabs/: off.
  + Activate /Custom Stylesheet/ and paste the contents of [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ranmaru22/firefox-vertical-tabs/main/tabCenterReborn.css][tabCenterReborn.css]] into the text area below, and click "Save CSS" under the textbox.
